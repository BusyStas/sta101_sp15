Newly divorced and at a crossroads, Gilbert steps out of her comfort zone, risking everything to change her life, embarking on a journey around the world that becomes a quest for self-discovery. In her travels, she discovers the true pleasure of nourishment by eating in Italy; the power of prayer in India, and, finally and unexpectedly, the inner peace and balance of true love in Bali.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KTitEyHG06uq7Ythwb8OEaYIwd0=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/16/11151694_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KTitEyHG06uq7Ythwb8OEaYIwd0=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/16/11151694_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KTitEyHG06uq7Ythwb8OEaYIwd0=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/16/11151694_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KTitEyHG06uq7Ythwb8OEaYIwd0=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/16/11151694_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Julia Roberts","id":"162659460","characters":["Liz Gilbert"]},{"name":"James Franco","id":"162653202","characters":["David Piccolo"]},{"name":"Richard Jenkins","id":"317606141","characters":["Richard From Texas"]},{"name":"Viola Davis","id":"162655119","characters":["Delia Shiraz"]},{"name":"Billy Crudup","id":"162660766","characters":["Stephen"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Ryan Murphy"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0879870"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0879870","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eat_pray_love/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770857925/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770857925/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770857925/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770857925.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
