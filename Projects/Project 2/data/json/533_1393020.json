As a young boy, Dury nearly died after being stricken with polio. Though the ravaging disease would leave him permanently disabled, however, it would also instill him with the drive and perseverance to become one of the most influential musicians of his generation. Along with his band Ian Dury & the Blockheads, the unpredictable rocker would become a key figure in the new wave movement of the late '70s. But through it all Dury's abrasive behavior never subsided, even during quiet moments with his delicate young son, Baxter (Bill Milner). Ray Winstone, Naomie Harris, and Olivia Williams co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3Rag5OwM9kDa5BtFAL-AJrfDteI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168668_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3Rag5OwM9kDa5BtFAL-AJrfDteI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168668_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3Rag5OwM9kDa5BtFAL-AJrfDteI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168668_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3Rag5OwM9kDa5BtFAL-AJrfDteI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168668_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Andy Serkis","id":"269710329","characters":["Ian Dury"]},{"name":"Bill Milner","id":"528392141","characters":["Baxter Dury"]},{"name":"Ray Winstone","id":"162693523","characters":["Bill Dury"]},{"name":"Naomie Harris","id":"162705781","characters":["Denise Roudette"]},{"name":"Tom Hughes","id":"770842584","characters":["Chaz Jankel"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mat Whitecross"}],"studio":"Lipsync Productions","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1393020"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1393020","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sex-drugs-rock-roll-2009/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810558/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810558/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810558/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810558.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
