\item Subtraction and logs: $log(a) - log(b) = log(\frac{a}{b})$

\item Natural logarithm: $e^{log(x)} = x$

\item We can these identities to ``undo" the log transformation

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interpreting models with log transformation (cont.)}

The slope coefficient for the log transformed model is 0.14, meaning the \underline{log} price difference between cars that are one year apart is predicted to be 0.14 log dollars.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{log(price at year $x + 1$)} - \text{log(price at year $x$)} &=& 0.14 \\
\pause
log \pr{ \frac{\text{price at year $x + 1$}}{\text{price at year $x$}} } &=& 0.14 \\
\pause
e^{log \pr{ \frac{\text{price at year $x + 1$}}{\text{price at year $x$}} }} &=& e^{0.14} \\
\pause
\frac{\text{price at year $x + 1$}}{\text{price at year $x$}} &=& 1.15
\end{eqnarray*}

\pause

For each additional year the car is newer (for each year decrease in car's age) we would expect the price of the car to increase on average \red{by a factor of 1.15}.

\frametitle{Recap: dealing with non-constant variance}

\begin{itemize}

\item Non-constant variance is one of the most common model violations, however it is usually fixable by transforming the response ($y$) variable

\pause

\item The most common variance stabilizing transform is the log transformation: $log(y)$, especially useful when the response variable is (extremely) right skewed.

\pause

\item When using a log transformation on the response variable the interpretation of the slope changes: \pause
\begin{itemize}
\item For each unit increase in $x$, y is expected on average to decrease/increase by a factor of $e^{b_1}$.
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item Another useful transformation is the square root: $\sqrt{y}$, especially useful when the response variable is counts.

\pause

\item These transformations may also be useful when the relationship is non-linear, but in those cases a polynomial regression may also be needed.

\end{itemize}
