\frametitle{Tips for the project}

\begin{itemize}

\item Pick a main focus and use that to tell a cohesive story throughout the various parts of the assignment.

\item You do not have to have audience score as the response variable for each analysis, only for the MLR part.

\item Do not mix-and-match model selection methods.

\item Your full model does not have to include all potential variables, though you should have (and state) a reason for why you chose to exclude any that you do.

\item You do not need to have a printed poster, and you can come look at examples in my office.

\item Other questions?

\end{itemize}
