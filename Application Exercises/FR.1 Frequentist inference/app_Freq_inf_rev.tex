Dr. \c{C}etinkaya-Rundel \hfill Data Analysis and Statistical Inference \\

\ttl{Application exercise \appno{}: \\
Frequentist inference review}

\inst{Submit your responses on \Sakai{}, under the appropriate assignment. Only one submission per team is required. One team will be randomly selected and their responses will be discussed.}

Earlier you decided how many M\&Ms to buy, accordingly your sample is one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item $n = 5 \rightarrow$ $\red{R}\green{G}\yellow{Y}\blue{B}\orange{O}$
\item $n = 10 \rightarrow$ $\red{R}\green{G}\yellow{Y}\blue{B}\orange{O} \quad \blue{B}\blue{B}\green{G}\orange{O}\yellow{Y}$
\item $n = 15 \rightarrow$ $\red{R}\green{G}\yellow{Y}\blue{B}\orange{O} \quad \blue{B}\blue{B}\green{G}\orange{O}\yellow{Y} \quad  \yellow{Y}\red{R}\blue{B}\red{R}\red{R} $
\item $n = 20 \rightarrow$ $\red{R}\green{G}\yellow{Y}\blue{B}\orange{O} \quad \blue{B}\blue{B}\green{G}\orange{O}\yellow{Y} \quad  \yellow{Y}\red{R}\blue{B}\red{R}\red{R} \quad  \green{G}\orange{O}\red{R}\blue{B}\yellow{Y}$
\end{itemize}

Answer the following questions using your sample only.

\begin{enumerate} 

\item What is your sample size? This is your $n$.

\item How many yellows are in your sample? This is your $k$.

\item Calculate the p-value using the Binomial distribution:

p-value = P(k or more yellows $|$ n, \%yellow is 10\%)

\item Do you reject the null hypothesis based on the $\alpha$ you chose earlier?

\item What is the conclusion of your hypothesis test, i.e. what do you report to your boss?

\end{enumerate}
